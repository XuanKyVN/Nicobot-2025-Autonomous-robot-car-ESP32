hi, Can you write for me about the introduction of a ROBOT Control SOFTWARE name is ROBOTCAR Application with about 1000 words with clearly discription for example.  This robot car controll application is designed by Python PYQT6 for control automatic car.  the main controller for Car is ESP32-S3, and High level controller can be Raspberry PI5 or Computer PC. This Car can be controlled by 7 ways.  1. Manual control by Remote PS2, 2. Control manually by Webserver directly on ESP32, 3. Control manually by Websocket Client on Local PC, 4. Controll by Lora signal from local PC with distance is about 2km in open space, 6. Control by Android application on android phone.  7. Automatically Controll by Camera front and Aft , direction and postion will be put buy GPS and Google Map, Compass Sensor.  Communication protocal is including  : 1. Websocket server and client , Webserver and client, MQTT, LORA Serial Communication.   the python robot car software used 2 ways of communication method, 1. MQTt, 2. LORA communication.  Why we use 2 ways of communication? because to prevent loss communication when robot car go to open area without internet or it is too far form main controller, the LORA communication will be used to transfer data from robot car to Main PC or then Main PC can easily pass data to MQTT to Internet,  That All thanks.
